However, I had no given requirements because they were unknown (legacy software). We had to understand the system and make our own requirements.","I did not understand the scope of the ontology. Does it apply to all real-time systems? If yes, should one distinguish between different types of real-time systems such as cars and airplanes because they may have different requirements. They may e.g. have to fulfill different safety levels that e.g. define whether deadlines are e.g. hard or soft. If the ontology does not differ between types of real-time systems, then it may provide information that is not required for the considered real-time system. 

Maybe one could specify in the beginning what kind of real-time system is being applied. After this specification, the appropriate ontology is adjusted so that the user is only provided with information that are relevant for their type of real-time system.",No,No,500 - 5000

I have an experience regarding the requirements of the systems as we do not use any traceability tool.","I think the ontology covers the basic requirements in the field of development, but it is possible to add more additional requirements that contribute to the generalization of the ontology to be able to use it in wider fields.","I think as manager I have to manage the team of any project since we start gathering the requirement until we deliver the final project for quality assurance so I need to have the  skills for that kind of job.

Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Agree,Neutral,Agree,Strongly agree,Agree,Strongly agree,"A few person days on requirements analysis compared to when performed without an ontology. Many person days of rework on wrongly implemented multithreading solutions that overlooked threats. Many person months of damage control in case of large-scale, high-risk failure due to threats that were not accounted for.","I believe threats could be linked to strategies to prevent the threat or mitigate its severity. That would provide a practical guide what are possible ways to deal with identified threats (in the context of multithreading). A second addition could be that because the number of threats is overseeable, there might actually be a possibility to provide in reusable requirements (including requirements patterns or requirements artifacts) for this purpose.",Agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,"It might be that there are other threats related to some of the other ISO 25010 quality characteristics (types of non-functional requirements) that were not addressed in the work.
